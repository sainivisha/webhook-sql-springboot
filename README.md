## Webhook-Based SQL Automation System

This project is a Java Spring Boot backend application designed to automate a webhook-driven SQL processing workflow. 
The system receives webhook requests, processes SQL-based tasks dynamically, executes queries on a MySQL database, 
and returns structured API responses.

The application focuses on clean REST API design, database correctness, error handling, and real-world backend 
request–response workflows.
